**Description**

I got sick of having to code these darn things repeatedly, so I decided to put together a little stylesheet add on.


**Usage**

All you need to do is:

1. Download or Clone this repo
2. Open the `style.css` file in the CSS directory
3. Copy and Paste the code into your site's existing style.css, or as a new css resource. Your call, really.
4. Implement a note with `<div class="note">`, implement a caution with `<div class="caution">`


**Things to keep in mind**

- Sometimes your theme doesn't play nice with the padding and margins. Sometimes it does. You might need to mess around a little bit to get it to look right.
- I use PNGs. I think you can probably use SVGs, and that might be better. If someone wants to send in a PR with a good CDN link, that'd be cool.
- I snagged the icons from Font Awesome because I use those ones but you can swap them out for whatever you want, really.
- Please use your own CDN resources for the background images.
